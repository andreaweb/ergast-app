## Ergast App

Install with ```yarn install```

Run with ```yarn start```

Used webpack & Sass (scss). Normalize helps keep browsers more uniform, while utilities and variables avoid repetition and make my job easier! 

The scss of individual components are empty due to how small the project is and the CSS used is mostly page-agnostic (table happens in both pages, buttons and links could be included in any, etc). If you want to see more on how I deal with CSS for larger projects, I suggest you check https://github.com/andreaweb/desafio-frontend

If you have any feedback on my code or UI/UX, please let me know!
